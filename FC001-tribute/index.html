        George Boole (2 November 1815 â€“ 8 December 1864) was a largely self-taught English mathematician, philosopher and logician,
        most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He
        worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of
        Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the information
        age. Boole maintained that:
        <section>
            No general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly
            recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which
            are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical
            as to their form.
        </section>
        Boole's status as mathematician was recognised by his appointment in 1849 as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's
        College, Cork (now University College Cork (UCC)) in Ireland. He met his future wife, Mary Everest, there in 1850
        while she was visiting her uncle John Ryall who was Professor of Greek. They married some years later in 1855. He
        maintained his ties with Lincoln, working there with E. R. Larken in a campaign to reduce prostitution. Boole was
        awarded the Keith Medal by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1855 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)
        in 1857. He received honorary degrees of LL.D. from the University of Dublin and the University of Oxford.
        <section>
            Boole conceived of "elective symbols" of his kind as an algebraic structure. But this general concept was not available to
            him: he did not have the segregation standard in abstract algebra of postulated (axiomatic) properties of operations,
            and deduced properties. His work was a beginning to the algebra of sets, again not a concept available to Boole
            as a familiar model. His pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties, and the treatment of addition
            was an obvious difficulty in the early days.
